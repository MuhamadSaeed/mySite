                    I am from Egyptâ€”a land rich in history and culture. Since childhood, I have been passionate about art and design, always striving to create with a unique perspective. I also love building things that are useful to others.
                    <br /> <br />
                    I started coding in high school, and to me, coding is another form of art. It allows me to combine design and functionality, which I find truly fascinating. I enjoy the creative process and the endless possibilities it offers.
                    <br /> <br />
                    My vision is to contribute to making the world a better place. As everything around us evolves, it's our turn to create meaningful innovations that positively impact lives.
